FlatCurry: An intermediate language for Curry programs
======================================================

This package contains libraries to deal with *FlatCurry programs*.
FlatCurry is an intermediate language to represent Curry programs
where a lot of syntactic sugar has been eliminated.
In particular, operations defined by general rules with
local declarations and pattern matching
are represented in FlatCurry by a single rule containing
case expressions and disjunctions in its right-hand side.
The precise structure of FlatCurry is defined in the
module `FlatCurry.Types`.

Usage of FlatCurry
------------------

Usually, the front end of Curry systems (like PAKCS or KiCS2)
translates a Curry program into an intermediate FlatCurry program
in order to further compile it into the target code.
Furthermore, the FlatCurry representation is used to
analyze or verify properties of Curry programs.
When implementing such Curry language tools,
it is important to understand the FlatCurry representation
and how it is obtained from a Curry program.
For this purpose, one can use the
[Curry browser](https://cpm.curry-lang.org/pkgs/currybrowse.html)
which has options to show the FlatCurry representation
of a Curry program in various forms.
One can also the Curry front end to print the FlatCurry
representation in a human-readable format.
For this purpose, one could add the line

    {-# OPTIONS_FRONTEND -ddump-flat #-}

at the beginning of a Curry program.

Type declarations in FlatCurry
------------------------------

Note that definition of types introduced by `data` or `newtype`
declarations are still present in FlatCurry.
Although a `newtype` declaration can be considered as syntactic sugar
for a type synonym, a `newtype` declaration is important for
typing reasons, i.e., a `newtype` is different from a type synonym.
Thus, if one wants to translate FlatCurry programs into typed target languages
(e.g., Haskell), the information about a `newtype` might be relevant.
However, if the target language is untyped, every use of a `newtype`
can be eliminated by dropping the `newtype` constructors
in the FlatCurry program. This can be done by operations
provided by the module `FlatCurry.ElimNewtype`.

Modules of the package
----------------------

Currently, this package contains the following modules:

* `FlatCurry.Compact`: This module contains operations to reduce the size
  of FlatCurry programs by combining the main module and all imports
  into a single program that contains only the operations directly or
  indirectly called from a set of main operations.
* `FlatCurry.ElimNewtype`: This module contains operations to eliminate
  definitions and uses of `newtype` in a FlatCurry program.
* `FlatCurry.Files`: This module defines operations to read and write
  FlatCurry programs.
* `FlatCurry.FlexRigid`: provides an operation to compute the rigid/flex status
  of a FlatCurry expression (typically, the right-hand side of a rule).
* `FlatCurry.Goodies`: This library provides selector operations, test and
  update operations as well as some useful auxiliary operations
  for FlatCurry data terms.
* `FlatCurry.Normalize`: This module contains operations to transform
  FlatCurry entities into some normalized form so that they can be easier
  compared for equivalence.
* `FlatCurry.Pretty`: This library provides pretty-printers for
  FlatCurry modules and all substructures (e.g., expressions).
* `FlatCurry.Read`: This library defines operations to read FlatCurry programs
  or interfaces together with all its imported modules in the current
  load path.
* `FlatCurry.Show`: This library contains operations to transform
  FlatCurry programs into string representations, either in a
  FlatCurry format or in a Curry-like syntax.
* `FlatCurry.Types`: This module defines the data types to represent
  FlatCurry programs in Curry.
* `FlatCurry.XML`: This module contains operations to convert FlatCurry
  programs into corresponding XML expressions and vice versa.
  This can be used to store Curry programs in a way independent
  of a Curry system or to use a Curry system, like PAKCS,
  as back end by other functional logic programming systems.
  The [DTD](http://www.curry-lang.org/docs/flatcurry.dtd) to validate
  these XML representation is also contained in file `flatcurry.dtd`.
